          <p class="shelter-info">
            At the Sea Turtle Shellter, we are dedicated to rescuing and caring for endangered Sea
            Turtles. Our mission is to fix up sea turtles that have been predated on or have had
            their habitats destroyed. We see sea turtles that have missing limbs, turtles that are
            malnourished, or young sea turtles that can not survive on their own. We do our best to
            help protect these turtles until they become self-sufficient again and are able to go
            back into the ocean again.

          <p class="shelter-info">
            Our team of volunteers helps Sea Turtles through the rehabilitation process before being
            fully ready to re-integrate into ocean life. We take the time and care to make sure that
            each individual Sea Turtle gets the specific care it needs. Some of our rehabilitation
            programs involve teaching sea turtles how to use prosthetic limbs, helping young turtles
            swim properly, and designing feeding regimens for malnourished sea turtles.
